# AdGroupOperation
Represents the definition of an ad group constructed via [AdGroupBuilder](./AdGroupBuilder). The ad group is added to the campaign only when one of this object's methods is invoked or when the script finishes execution, whichever comes first. To improve performance, store the operation objects in an array and only invoke its methods when all operations have been constructed.
